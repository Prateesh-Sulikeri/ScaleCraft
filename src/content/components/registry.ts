/**
 * The global component registry — every chapter references components from
 * here by id via `availableComponentIds`; components are never redefined per
 * chapter. Generated from declarative `ComponentConfigSpec` data, one file
 * per category, under `./config/` (see .claude/docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md's
 * Color System table for the same six categories) purely for file size —
 * this barrel is still the single source of truth other modules import from.
 * Covers the full "Core Components" list from INITIAL_THOUGHTS.md.
 *
 * To add a built-in component: add one object to the array in the right
 * `./config/*.ts` file. `generateComponentRegistry` picks it up
 * automatically, and throws immediately on a bad icon key, an empty enum,
 * or a duplicate id.
 *
 * One thing does NOT happen automatically, though — you should also
 * declare `relations` (see ./types.ts's `ComponentRelations`): which
 * categories/kinds are legal for this component's inputs and outputs.
 * Skipping it doesn't break anything (validation-engine/rules/
 * component-relations.ts falls back to the coarse category-level matrix in
 * canvas/legal-edge-kinds.ts for any component with no declared contract —
 * the same fallback custom, user-authored components always use), but the
 * new component won't get the precise, component-specific checking every
 * other base-pack component has. See .claude/docs/validation_agent_design.md
 * for the full rationale.

/**
 * Every user-created custom component (see CreateComponentModal.tsx) lives

 * configSchema can't be un-rendered back into editable field specs, see
 * store.ts's comment on `customComponents`). `getAllComponents` builds a
 * real ComponentDefinition from each record on demand and merges both lists
 * so Palette/ContextMenu show one combined, reactive list. A plain
 * `useCanvasStore.getState()` snapshot read (not the `useCanvasStore()`
 * hook) is safe here: a custom component is always registered before it's
 * ever placed on canvas, so `getComponent` doesn't need to be reactive to
 * find one — it just needs the current list at call time.
